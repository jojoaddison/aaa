                                <span style="color:#f6dc5e; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bolder;">Welcome to AAA e.V. in DÃ¼sseldorf!</span><br>
                                The AAA e.V. set itself the goal of afforestation  and reforestation of forests in regions  that currently have little or no trees due  to extreme climatic conditions.<br>
                                <br>
                                The primary goal is to show African communities how to sustainably harness natural resources, protect the environment whilst creating improved living conditions at the same time.
                                Forests should have a  wide range of trees. It is important to ensure that different types  of trees such as  palms, mahogany,
                                other wood species as well as cashew and mango are  combined to reduce the susceptibility to pests.<br>
                                <br>
                                It might also be possible to plant trees from  other continents that are able to  survive even in these difficult climatic  conditions.
                                A successful cultivation of fruit and wood could improve local communities and the living standards of its people.
                                In a global  context afforestation projects
                                should help to reduce global warming because trees can absorb carbon dioxide during photosynthesis  and counteract the greenhouse effect.<br>
                                <br>
                                We are a group of active volunteers for non-profit. We appreciate any kind of support. Get in touch  with us!

                        <h4><strong>Our Aims</strong></h4>
                        <p>
                            The project is based on the needs of the local communities.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The project provides benefits that on sustainable and not temporal.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The project does not require the community to spend any of their own money but to contribute part of their land and do communal labor.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The project structure would address the needs of local families as well as bringing important benefit to larger environmental
                            communities, e. g. reducing the threat of flooding, bushfires as well as stopping the rampant desert in Africa.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The project would therefore prevent irreparable destruction of forestry in Africa.

                             The project centre would organize technical training for the youth.

                        <p>
                             The project will develop yearly until experts have found the best trees for afforestation.

                        <p>

                        <p>
                            The aim of the centre is to promote a strategic competence in community reafforestation
                            and environmentally healthy establishment of forests in parts of Africa, where
                            hitherto there were no trees, or reestablish forest in areas where it has disappeared.
                            In doing so we want to apply modern methods of tree planting - using the waterboxx
                            as a brilliant example alongside other traditional methods.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The centre is to be established in the town of Mafi-Anfoe found in the Volta Region of Ghana.
