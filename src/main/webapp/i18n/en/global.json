Forests should have a wide range of trees. It is important to ensure that different types of trees such as palms, mahogany, other wood species as well as cashew and mango are combined to reduce the susceptibility to pests.</p><p>It might also be possible to plant trees from other continents that are able to survive even in these difficult climatic conditions. A successful cultivation of fruit and wood could improve local communities and the living standards of its people. In a global context afforestation projects should help to reduce global warming because trees can absorb carbon dioxide during photosynthesis and counteract the greenhouse effect.</p><p>We are a group of active volunteers for non-profit. We appreciate any kind of support. Get in touch with us!</p>",
